About "elif"
------------
There is a user-defined macro that is not defined in C standard although C compiler completely compile all the code with C99 standard. It is "elif". If you have experienced with Python, you may know it. However, I added and used it for not being frustrated repeating "else if" again and again, and fun a bit. One more thing is that in Turkey, capitalized "Elif" is a common girls' name[1]. Of course, I know this is the way against coding standard, but I DO NOT do this in industry. For your information, this is my side project. Just have fun!
